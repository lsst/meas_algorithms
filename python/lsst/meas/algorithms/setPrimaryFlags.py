def getDeblendPrimaryFlags(sources):
    """Get flags generated by the deblender.

    scarlet is different than meas_deblender in that it is not
    (necessarily) flux conserving. For consistency in scarlet,
    all of the parents with only a single child (isolated sources)
    need to be deblended. This creates a question: which type
    of isolated source should we make measurements on, the
    undeblended "parent" or the deblended child?
    For that reason we distinguish between a DeblendedSource,
    which is a source that has no children and uses the
    isolated parents, and a DeblendedModelSource, which uses
    the scarlet models for both isolated and blended sources.
    In the case of meas_deblender, DeblendedModelSource is
    `None` because it is not contained in the output catalog.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sources : `lsst.afw.table.SourceCatalog`
        A sourceCatalog that has already been deblended using
        either meas_extensions_scarlet or meas_deblender.

    Returns
    -------
    fromBlend : array-like of `bool`
        True for each source modeled by the deblender from a `Peak`
        in a parent footprint that contained at least one other `Peak`.
        While these models can be approximated as isolated,
        and measurements are made on them as if that's the case,
        we know deblending to introduce biases in the shape and centroid
        of objects and it is important to know that the sources that these
        models are based on are all bleneded in the true image.
    isIsolated : array-like of `bool`
        True for isolated sources, regardless of whether or not they
        were modeled by the deblender.

        True for each source that is a "DeblendedSource" as defined above.
